Regular License

    1. The Regular License grants you an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have downloaded. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Item.

    2. You are licensed to use the Item within the WordPress Theme that it comes with. You can create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product can be distributed for Free.

    3. An End Product is one of the following things, both requiring an application of skill and effort.

        (a)For an Item that is a template, the End Product is a customised implementation of the Item.

        For example: the item is a website theme and the end product is the final website customised with your content.

        (b) For other types of Item, an End Product is a work that incorporates the Item as well as other things, so that it is larger in scope and different in nature than the Item.


You can do with the Item

    4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.

    5. You can make any number of copies of the single End Product, as long as the End Product is distributed for Free.

    6. You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.


You can't do with the Item

    7. You can’t Sell the End Product, except to one client. 

    8. You can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Item. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for Free. 

    9. Although you can modify the Item and therefore delete unwanted components before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis.

    10. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it separately from the End Product.

    11. You can’t use an Item in a logo, trademark, or service mark.
